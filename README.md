Interests: Health care, programming, environmental science, human rights

Projects:

    NYC_flood_data_project.Rmd
        In this project, I worked with a group from my class to visualize flood plain data. The data was organized by coordinates with information
        about the flood plains. My main contribution to the project was determining how to visualize the polygons of each flood plain in R using
        the coordinates from the data.
    airplane_cpp.cpp
        This was my first project completed in C++. It was an assignment in which I created a virtual plane seating arrangement. Users of the
        program can choose a seat on the plane, make changes to their seats, and more. It is highly error-proof. I created this assignment after
        my first few monthts of self-taught C++ where I learned the language and basic programming concepts to test into the second computer
        science course at my college. This was my favorite project from the first few months of programming.
    final_project_RStats.Rmd
        In this project, I presented on human trafficking. I analyzed big data from many countries around the world to determine the prevalence of 
        human trafficking in different areas among various demographics.
    final_project_dataAcqAndManage.Rmd
        In this project, I presented on the water crisis. My data showed the water usage by country, and I analyzed the efficiency of water use to 
        demonstrate my ability to create visuals in R.
    nlp_grading_essays.py
        In this file, I show one of the scripts I wrote for my research assistant position at CUNY. This file imports data about student essays and 
        creates models that can predict the scores of individual categories for each essay. The script also analyzes the accuracy of the models. As
        the semester continues, more features will be added to better predict the grades, and other models like random forest will be used in place
        of linear regression. Note: the actual files used for this script will not be posted.
    project_2_RStats.Rmd
        The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to clean untidy data and then analyze the data. With the hospital data, I compared 
        EMS admissions based on severity, compared the 24-hour services offered by emergency departments, and determined the months with the most 
        ambulance diversion. With the insurance data, I determined the year in which NY state contained the fewest people who were insured, and I 
        determined which states had the highest rates of people wihtout insurance. With the countries data, I compared the mortality rate of male and
        female adults to the total populations of male and females in different countries, and I compared the public and private health expenditure 
        in the countries over time for the countries that had the top 5 highest populations in 2015.
